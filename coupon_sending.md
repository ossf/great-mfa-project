# Coupons for a critical project

## Background

The following draft text is to be sent by a "sender" to a
critical project's PRIVATE email address (or similar private channel),
once they've agreed to accept the coupon and validation codes.

Improvements welcome!

## Sending coupon and validation code text

Thanks so much for being willing to use these 
*free* multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens!

Below are the coupon codes for the Google Titan tokens and/or
the validation codes for the GitHub Yubikey tokens.
Please distribute each one to maintainers and contributors to your
project and/or any open source software projects that your project depends on.
DO NOT make the codes public, each code can only be used *once*.

The Google coupon codes *must* be used by the end of 2021
(they expire afterwards).
If you decide not to use any coupon codes or validation codes, please
tell us as soon as possible so we can give them to someone else.

Those getting the Titan tokens from Google would use the Google Store's page for Titan tokens at <https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key>.
We have step-by-step instructions for getting a Titan token at <https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/getting-titan-token-from-google.md>.

Those getting the Yubikey tokens from GitHub would first use a Google form
to turn the validation code into a coupon code, at
<https://forms.gle/zYLbdmGsgAFbeZr26>.
They would then use the GitHub Shop's Yubikey page at <https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-branded-yubikey?_pos=1&_sid=4893867a7&_ss=r>.
We have step-by-step instructions for getting a Yubikey token at <https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/getting-yubikey-token-from-github.md>.

To qualify, each token recipient must:

1. Be a maintainer or contributor to this critical open source software (OSS)
   project, or to another OSS project that this project depends on
   (the dependency may be indirect).
2. Try to use an MFA token to secure their GitHub Account once they receive the token.
   We'd like recipients to use MFA tokens from then on, but at least try.
3. Not reuse the token between different people (the token must not be shared).
4. Consider providing feedback to us (so we can try to fix problems).

We also need each project that receives coupon codes and/or validation codes
to tell us these numbers (preferably within 30 days of getting the codes):

1. How many tokens did you distribute from just Google? From just GitHub?
2. How many people received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?
3. How many people didnâ€™t have hardware tokens they used for OSS who received tokens from just Google? From just GitHub? From both?

The people you sent the coupon and validation codes to
should be able to tell you this!
We need this information so we can tell others some simple measures of success.
We don't need the names of any individuals.

Please note that the tokens are shipped from the US, so while they
can be shipped internationally, we can't ship somewhere if that is
forbidden (sanctioned) under US law as listed on
<https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information>.
So unless rules change we can't ship them to China, Afghanistan, Russia,
Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria.  Sorry about that.
Google Titan Key tokens are purchased directly from the store and are only
available in select regions listed on <https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key#section-5>.

We provide how-tos and other information at the
"Great Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Distribution Project" site:
